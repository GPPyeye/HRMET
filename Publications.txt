Publications Using HRMET - feel free to add your own, along with a couple bullet-point highlights:

1. Zipper, S.C. & S.P. Loheide II (2014). Using evapotranspiration to
   assess drought sensitivity on a subfield scale with HRMET, a high
   resolution surface energy balance model. Agricultural & Forest
   Meteorology 197: 91-102. DOI: 10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.06.009
-Introduce and describe HRMET; validate for rainfed corn in south-central Wisconsin
-Use HRMET output to map drought sensitivity
-Drought sensitivity varies as a function of soil texture and water table depth
